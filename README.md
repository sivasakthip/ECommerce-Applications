# Project Description:

Database Integration: It includes integration with a relational database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL) using JPA/Hibernate for data persistence.
Security: Implements security features using Spring Security for authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT tokens).
Product Management: APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and fetching product details.
User Management: APIs for user registration, login, profile management.
Order Management: APIs to handle order creation, tracking, and payment processing.
Other Features: Includes other necessary functionalities such as email notifications, cart management, and payment gateway integration.

# Frontend (Angular)
User Interface: A responsive and dynamic UI built with Angular that interacts with the backend services.
Components: Reusable Angular components for product listing, product details, shopping cart, checkout process, user profile, and order history.
Routing: Angular routing for navigating between different views and components.
State Management: Utilizes Angular services and state management tools like NgRx for managing the application state.
Form Handling: Reactive forms for user inputs, validations, and submission.
Styling: Styled using CSS/SCSS for a modern and clean look.
